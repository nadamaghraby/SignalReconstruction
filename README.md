# signal-sampling-and-reconstruction
#### it is able to reconstruct a signal at the least processin time possible by utilizing The Nyquistâ€“Shannon theory
### its main features are:

#### Allow the user to open a mid-length signal and show it on the main graph

#### The user can sample the read signal and see the sampled points highlighted on top of the signal

#### The user can change the sampling rate via a slider that range from 0 Hz to 3fmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency in the read signal

#### The app recovers the signal from the sampled points

### The user sees the reconstructed signal from the sampled points in two ways:

#### As a dotted signal on top of the original signal
#### A new signal in a secondary graph below the main graph.
#### The user can toggle the visibility of the secondary graph

### it provides the user with a primitive signal composer where s/he can generate basic signals to test and validate on the app.
